# GSheet-and-Kirk
Call opening in Kirk via Google Sheet using AppScript

The system aims to instantiate Kirk's process with Google Sheets in the first part.

Once instantiated, it gives you the option to search for invoices on Google Drive based on the NF field and returns you the invoice link.

And then send the information filled in the spreadsheet to the Kirk system, causing it to open calls and return the IDK value.
